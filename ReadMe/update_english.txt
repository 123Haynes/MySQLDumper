Updating an older Version of MySQLDumper:

- overwrite all files with the new ones
- call MySQLDumper in your browser, go to the configuration and clicke "save"
- when you are running crondump.pl via cronjob: remember to update the name of the configuration file in the call of the cronjob 
(up to version 1.21 it was named mysqldumper.conf - now it is called mysqldumper.conf.php !)

Notice:
maybe you will some warnings on your way to the configuration: ["undefinde index ..."]. 
Ignore that. After saving the new configuration theses warnings are gone.
