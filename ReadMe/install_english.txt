Guidance for the Perl script:  

Most have a cgi-bin directory, in which Perl can be executed. 
This is usually by Browser over http://www.domain.de/cgi-bin/ available. 

Make the following steps for this case please.  

1.  Call in MySQLDumper the page Backup and click "Backup Perl".
2.  Copy the path, that stands behind entry in crondump.pl for $absolute_path_of_configdir:    
3. open the file "crondump.pl" in the editor 
4. paste the copied path there with absolute_path_of_configdir (no blanks) 
5.  Save crondump.pl 
6. copy crondump.pl, as well as perltest.pl and simpletest.pl to the cgi-bin directory (ASCII mode in the ftp-client!) 
7. chmod 755 to the scripts.  
7b. If the ending cgi is desired, change the ending of all 3 files  pl - > cgi (rename)  
8.  Call in the MySQLDumper the page Configuration
9. click on Cronscript 
10. changes Perl execution path to /cgi-bin/
10b. if the Scripts are renamed to *.cgi , change Fileextension to cgi 
11 save the Configuration 

Ready ! The scripts are available from the Page "Backup" 

When you can execute Perl anywhere, only following step are needed:  

1.  Call in MySQLDumper the page Backup.  
2.  Copy the path, that stands behind entry in crondump.pl for $absolute_path_of_configdir:  
3. open the file "crondump.pl" in the editor 
4. paste the copied path there with absolute_path_of_configdir (no blanks) 
5.  Save crondump.pl 

6. chmod 755 to the scripts.   
6b. If the ending cgi is desired, change the ending of all 3 files  pl - > cgi (rename)  
(ev. 10b+11 from above) 


Windowsuser must change the first line of all Perlscripts, to the path of Perl.  

Example:  

instead of:  #!/usr/bin/perl w 
now #!C:\perl\bin\perl.exe w
